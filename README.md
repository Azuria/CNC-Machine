CNC-Machine
===========

Designs for my CNC router. Note - this is a machine under design. It hasn't been physically built yet!

Go to the [WIKI](https://github.com/Scalpel78/CNC-Machine/wiki) for description and bill of materials.

The design for the machine is done in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). The design is parametric - meaning it is easy to change the physical dimensions of the machine. Making it wider, longer or higher is just a matter of changing a parameter.

I'm trying to design the machine in such a way that it can use parts that are easy to get via Ebay, but there are a few parts (like the gantry sides) that will need to be custom made.

When designing the machine I've got certain criterias;
* Fit on a workbench in my small shed
* Be able to mill aluminum
