CNC-Machine
===========

Designs for my CNC machine. Note - this is a machine under design. It hasn't been physically built yet!

Go to the [WIKI](https://github.com/Scalpel78/CNC-Machine/wiki) for description and bill of materials.

The design for the machine is done in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). The design is parametric - meaning it is easy to change the physical dimensions of the machine. Making it wider, longer or higher is just a matter of changing a parameter.
